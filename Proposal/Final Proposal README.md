# Proposal

### What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Building a synthesizer with basic audio effects using PortAudio and PortMIDI in C.

### In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This project will be mainly serving to explore the programming logic behind digital synthesizer, as well as getting familiar with the design concept of digital audio effects. 

### In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This software will basically serving as a synthesizer prototype, with the ability to generate simple wavefroms such as sine wave, square wave, triangle wave and sawtooth wave. The user should be able to play scales with simple audio effects such as distortion, delay, reverb, etc; on the synthesizer through MIDI signals.


### In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

#### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Based on the current material and resource available, the project should at least be able to generate basic waveforms such as sine wave, square wave, sawtooth wave, and should at have 1 audio effect such as delay. 

#### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be a synthesizer that can be played scales on a midi keyboard.

#### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would a synthesizer that can be played scales on a midi keyboard, with several audio effects and the ability to apply multiple audio effects at the same time.

### In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

New skills such as playback funtions, portaudio and portMIDI coding will be needed for the final project, potential researching topics are: digital signal processing, signal input and output in binary, dealing with latency and buffer, and wavetable synthesis, etc.
